# YELL Website 
##Young Entreupreneurial Leadership Launchpad

This is a a group colaboration Wordpress site for our community partner, YELL. Our group comprised of Djordje Vujatovic, Kiana Aghaei, and Quinlan Deer. Together, we worked over 2 and a half weeks to perfect the design and functionality given to us by our partner design team. This is our final project from our time at RED Academy.

## Technologies Used

- Wordpress
- PHP
- SCSS
- HTML
- jQuery
- Javascript

## Learning Outcomes

The project taught us how to work and communicate with designers, clients, and most importantly, amongst ourselves. In addition, we have learned the process of setting up a wordpress backend which can be manipulated by the client if desired. 
We also grew a better understanding for the functionality and posibilities of wordpress through experimentation with taxonomies, field groups, plugins and custom post types.
